"have the "add button" link at the top of the page instead load a modal on top which loads in the html from the "/add-products" route to be able to add products. when the modal is closed, it will refresh the view in order to show the updated products list in the render"


resulted in a few failed attempts to put my "add" page in a modal, which would not sync appropriately with the backend service and its expected delivery mechanism and/or format.
