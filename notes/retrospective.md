# General Thoughts and Experience
- in general, can be more frustrating than just writing the code myself
- occasionally did what I wanted or exceeded expectations, but the time spent made it a hollow victory
- lots of reprompting
- turns out conveying ideas from very little substance is difficult to iterate on
- doesn't solve "creative aspects"
- gave some great direction to new ideas/concepts/libraries, and other times just had stale or bad info
- set lofty goals hoping that genAI would greatly accelerate dev timelines... didn't quite work out


# Future Ideas
- could see the prompts being automated and fed directly into render for html to see realtime changes and
shorten the distance between conversation/chat and reality
- copy pasting is tiresome


# Requirements 
- didn't get to finish email capabilities
- didn't get adequate test coverage
- didn't get to build microservices, instead made essentially a monolith (for now)
- no containerization
- no authentication or authorization mechanism
- cache instead of database



# Initial Goals Accomplished
- essentially have a barebones working POC that is decently setup for expansion
- got to experiment a little with a "monorepo" as a side effect
- got to experiement with go templates, having never used them for rendering
